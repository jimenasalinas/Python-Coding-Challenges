# Python Coding Challenges 2022

This repo is a collection of the Python problem sets I worked on during [UChicago's class CAPP121](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/index.html).

- [Modeling Epidemics](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa1/index.html) - basics of Python, translate simple algorithms into code
- [Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html) - nested loops, lists of lists, and functions
- [Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html) - dictionaries as a way to represent data
- [Polling places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html) - designing and implementing classes and methods
- [Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html) - NumPy, classes and functions to support code reuse
- [Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa6/index.html) - recursive data structures and functions

URLs redirect to each one of the projects' webpages. Due to policies of the MSCAPP, code solutions cannot be posted publicly. However, these could be shared by reaching me via email: [jimenas@uchicago.edu](mailto:jimenas@uchicago.edu).
